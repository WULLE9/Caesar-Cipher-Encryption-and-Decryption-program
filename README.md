Caesar Cipher is the simplest method in cryptography and it works as follows.
Encrypt Function: Shifts each character by the specified value while wrapping around the alphabet if necessary.
Decrypt Function: Reverses the encryption by shifting each character backward by the same value.
User Input: The program asks whether the user wants to encrypt or decrypt a message and then processes the input accordingly.
Repeat Option: After each operation, the user can choose to run another encryption/decryption or exit the program.
